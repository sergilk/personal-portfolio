          I have always been enthusiastic about technologies and computers for
          as long as I can remember. Currently, I am self-studying web
          development using various resources such as docs, yt videos, courses
          and other materials that help me to learn. At the same time, building
          projects is the most valuable, cuz they allow me to dive deeper into
          coding, gain a better understanding of core programming concepts, and
          learn how to solve `real` problems in practice.

          My goal is to become a professional web developer and somewhere down
          the road, a full-stack developer. I strive to create efficient,
          user-friendly, and modern web solutions, work with cutting-edge
          technologies, and continuously improve my skills so that each
          subsequent project is better than the last.
